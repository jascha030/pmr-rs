# PMR CLI (RS)

**Rust** rewrite of [jascha030/pmr-cli](https://github.com/jascha030/pmr-cli), which is _a small project management CLI utility, written in PHP to store project management related links._

The version mentioned above was originally intended as a prototype to be re-written in rust, I hadn't found the motivation to do so.

***Up till now that is ðŸŽ‰!***

<sub>
...Or Iguess up till almost that is ðŸŽ‰!!
Because this version is currently still a work in progress.
